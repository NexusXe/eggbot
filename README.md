# eggbot
A simple Python bot for Discord, made in discord.py.


# Usage
Replace `BOT_TOKEN` in `auth` with your Discord-provided bot token, and run from terminal with python3.

It is not reccomended to run the code as-is on multiple guilds, as it will build up a _very_ large queue and have awful response times.
